Welcome to the Mastermind game!

The objective of this game is to decipher a secret code, which by default consists of 4 symbols.
Once a game round starts, you must attempt to guess the code by selecting a combination of 4 symbols.
After each guess, the codekeeper will provide feedback, indicating which colors from your guess are present
in the actual solution. This will guide you in making subsequent attempts.

In the standard version of the game, you have 10 attempts to guess the code correctly, with each code
comprising 4 symbols. However, there's an option to customize these parameters, allowing you to set the
 number of attempts and the length of the code as per your preference.

This game is not only a test of logic and deduction but also an engaging and fun way to challenge your
problem-solving skills. So, gear up for an exciting journey of mystery and discovery in Mastermind!
